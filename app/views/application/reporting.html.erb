<h1>Reporting in General</h1>

Our standard reporting is weekly.   You’ll have a “dashboard” that will tell you what percentage of 

employees are participating, which questions they are answering right and wrong, which Speedbumps 

they are requesting, and how long they are spending on the app, among other things.   

Our ROI reporting is done annually.  Using the exacting specifications of the Validation Institute (rather 

than “we reduced risk factors among high-risk participants” or “we reduced your trend” charades), we 

provide you with a claims extraction template that asks you to pull the claims for the procedures, 

diagnostics and other items that we have guaranteed to reduce.  We commit to a turnaround time of 5 

business days from correct completion of this template.  So theoretically, if you have 90-day claims 

runout, you could know in early April 2016 how you did in 2015!  Even better, if you use 

www.healthentic.com as your claims analytics engine you can get a 24-hour turnaround, as they have 

trued up their data warehouse specifications to match ours.

How exacting are these reporting specifications?  Your own organization will have met the qualifications 

for the Validation Institute’s “Member-facing organization” Gold Standard validation.  No other vendor 

can offer that.  

<h1>Reporting on…Engagement???  Seriously???</h1>

We can also, uniquely, report on that elusive variable, the White Whale of Workplace Wellness:  

engagement.

How, you might ask?  We have some questions where the explanation of the right answer is more than 

100 words.   Instead of squeezing the entire explanation onto one screen, we have options at the bottom: 

<More> and <Next Question>.   Since people have already gotten the answer right and already earned 

their money, there is absolutely no reason to read the rest of the explanation of the answer other than 

simply being engaged by the Quizzify quiz.  The ratio of people asking for more information to people 

racing through to the next question is your objective measure of engagement.  No other wellness program 

can objectively measure engagement.  

Sure, they and we can measure “participation,” but that’s not the same thing.  That’s driven by the money, 

not the inherent worthiness of the program.  Want to raise your participation rate?  Throw money at a 

program.  Want to improve your employee engagement?  Give them a program that actually interests 

them.
