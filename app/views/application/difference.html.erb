Name an issue with your conventional wellness program, and Quizzify solves it.  And where relevant, we 

guarantee it.

Philosophy Employees don’t get enough medical care, 

so employers can save money by 

encouraging, paying, and/or requiring 

employees to get more. 

guarantee 

Many employees get too much medical 

care already.  The best approach is to 

help them learn how to pursue 

healthcare interventions only if and 

when appropriate 

Cost Savings Target Avoiding wellness-sensitive medical 

Perceived invasion of employee 

privacy by asking intrusive 

questions, weighing them etc. 

Employees lying on health risk 

assessments, losing respect for your 

organization 

Compliance with official screening 

guidelines 

Requiring and storing personal 

health information (PHI) 

Employee resentment and morale 

damage 

Measure outcomes Compare participants to non-participants, 

events (WSMEs), which account for less 

than 4% of your spending, most of which 

is not avoidable.  (Wellness vendors can’t 

save money on non-wellness-related 

medical care at all.) 

Explain that no one is supposed to see the 

results. 

Conveying to them the importance of 

telling the truth 

Don’t comply with guidelines.  (Vendors 

need to screen employees annually in order 

to make a profit.  Guidelines recommend 

far less frequent screening in order to 

avoid overdiagnosis and hazardous and 

expensive overtreatment.) 

Assure employees their information is 

safe, spend a lot of money (reflected in 

their price to you) for HIPAA compliance 

Recommend communications plan about 

how these programs will make employees 

happy whether they like it or not (ok, 

we’re exaggerating, but it’s a good line) 

even though that methodology is proven 

invalid 

Reducing waste and overuse, which 

account for about a third of your 

spending…and also reducing WSMEs 

by more than a wellness program 

would 

Don’t ask personal questions or weigh 

people. 

Don’t put them in a position where they 

need to lie 

Teach employees how to comply with 

guidelines to keep themselves healthy 

without undue risk of overtreatment.. 

Don’t require PHI…or even employee 

names 

Create a program that’s fun and 

educational, and guarantee engagement 

and satisfaction

it’s heathcare doesn’t mean it’s good 

for you.”
