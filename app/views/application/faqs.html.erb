<p><b>Q: You don’t seem to like conventional wellness programs, to put it mildly.  Does that mean we 
need to terminate our current program to use yours?</b><br>
A: You can keep your current program.  
<ol>
  <li> Quizzify can be implemented side-by-side with conventional wellness.  Our EEOC Inoculation 
  Guarantee (10x fees at risk) only requires that Quizzify be offered on an equal footing as an 
  option.</li> 
  <li> We are strong believers in wellness done for employees instead of to employees.  (We actually 
  invented that phrase, on p. 122 of Cracking Health Costs.)    That means we can assist you in 
  keeping the best components of your current program and swapping out the rest for Quizzify.</li>  
  <li> We can even customize questions for you to teach employees about your current wellness 
  program.</li>
  <li> Ironically we would like you to keep your current program as an option so that you can see how 
  much better ours works in real time.  We guarantee it.</li>
</ol>

<p><b>Q:  How does our current wellness staff fit in with this model?</b><br>
A:  They can focus on the part of their job that they’ve wanted to do all along:  helping employees 
become healthier. They will be thrilled to do wellness for employees instead of to them, trying to coax 
them into weigh-ins and blood draws that most want nothing to do with.  In terms of the difference in job 
satisfaction, one is reminded of the East Berlin border guard who, after being told to open the gates, 
remarked how much better he liked his job now that he could let people through instead of shooting them.</p>

<p><b>Q: A few of the sample questions were hard.  If we don’t know the answers, how can we expect our 
employees to know them? </b><br>
A: The point is that you and they shouldn’t know the answers already.  Otherwise, why ask the questions?  
The idea is to learn the answers.  Having said that, we do review our questions periodically and adjust 
those which people are both spending a lot of time on and also not getting right.</p>

<p><b>Q: We see what you are doing to make this material fun and cool, but we think some of these 
questions and the wording of some others is too edgy for our leadership to accept.  Can we change 
some working?</b><br>
A:  We can reword, rework and remove questions as you like.</p>

<p><b>Q:  How many questions do you have in stock?</b><br>
A:  Enough for 2 years, and we are writing them faster than you would use them.  We recommend only 
100/year.  Too many is too much information all at once.  And in subsequent years we repeat the 30 most 
incorrectly answered questions from the previous year, along with the new ones.</p>

<p><b>Q: We keep raising our penalties and incentives and can’t get participation or engagement to 
increase.  Do we need to spend more?</b><br>
A:  No.  We recommend budgeting no more than $100 per employee, out of your current incentive or 
penalty.   For programs that nobody wants to participate in, increasing the money at stake is the only blunt 
instrument available.  Quizzify stands on its own merits.  A small amount of money at stake adds to the 
fun but a large amount would make it too much like conventional wellness—all about getting paid and 
not about the offering itself.</p>

<p><b>Q:  Our benefits designs and choices are rather complex.  Can we use Quizzify to determine if 
employees are “getting” what we are trying to tell them?</b><br>
A: Of course.  We wouldn’t have listed this as an FAQ if we couldn’t.</p>
  
<p><b>Q:  Speaking of which, has anyone ever actually asked any of these FAQs?</b><br>
A:  Nope</p>
